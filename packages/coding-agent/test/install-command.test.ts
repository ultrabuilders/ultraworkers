/**
 * Regression test for #1496 (bug 2): `ultraworkers install ./my-extension` used to be
 * silently rewritten to `launch install ./my-extension` and forwarded to the
 * LLM as an initial prompt because no top-level `install` subcommand existed.
 *
 * These tests pin two invariants:
 *
 *  1. `install` is registered in the CLI command table, so the runner does
 *     not prepend `launch` and the args never reach the model.
 *  2. The local-path heuristic that routes `install ./foo` to `plugin link`
 *     while routing remote specs to `plugin install` is correct for the
 *     shapes users actually type.
