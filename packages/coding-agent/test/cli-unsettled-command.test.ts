// Regression: `ultraworkers config set collab.autoStart control` on a fresh Windows profile over WinRM
// exited 0 with no output and never wrote config.yml. The CLI entry is a floating `runCli()`
// call (top-level await breaks `--bytecode` builds), so a one-shot command whose await never
// settles and holds no live handle let the event loop drain, and Bun exited 0: an unfinished
// command reported as success. The process entry now fails that drain with exit 1 and a
// diagnostic. A preload makes `Settings.init` never settle to reach the same state. #12441
// reports the same silent exit 0 for `ultraworkers auth-broker token` on a fresh Windows profile; the
// stalled await itself is still unidentified.
//
// Regression #13470: on Windows Bun emits `beforeExit` while `ultraworkers update` still has I/O in
// flight, then keeps running the loop; the command completed but exited 1 with the diagnostic.
// Preloads that resume work from a `beforeExit` listener reproduce that runtime state.

 * This asks the question that is actually stable: did the command write the config
